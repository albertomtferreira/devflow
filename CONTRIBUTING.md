### 6. PR Requirements

Your PR should include:

- **Clear title and description** explaining what and why
- **Screenshots** for UI changes
- **Testing steps** for reviewers
- **Updated documentation** if needed
- **Linked issues** using keywords (fixes #123)

### 7. Code Review Process

- **Automated checks** must pass (linting, type-checking, build)
- **At least one maintainer** must approve
- **Address feedback** promptly and respectfully
- **Keep discussions** focused and constructive

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Define proper types** - avoid `any`
- **Export interfaces** for reusable types
- **Use strict mode** settings

```typescript
// Good
interface ProjectData {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: ProjectStatus;
}

// Avoid
const data: any = { ... };
```

### React Components

- **Use functional components** with hooks
- **Implement proper TypeScript props**
- **Use forwardRef** when needed
- **Keep components small** and focused

```tsx
// Good
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: "primary" | "secondary";
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export function Button({ variant, children, onClick }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button className={cn("btn", `btn-${variant}`)} onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Styling

- **Use Tailwind CSS** classes
- **Use the cn() utility** for conditional classes
- **Follow mobile-first** responsive design
- **Use CSS variables** for theming

```tsx
// Good
<div
  className={cn(
    "flex items-center gap-2 p-4",
    isActive && "bg-primary text-primary-foreground",
    "sm:p-6 md:gap-4"
  )}
/>
```

### File Organization

- **Group related files** in appropriate directories
- **Use descriptive names** for files and folders
- **Export from index files** when appropriate
- **Follow existing patterns**

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/           # Base UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/     # Project-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ navigation/   # Navigation components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/      # Server actions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts      # Type definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.ts      # Utility functions
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Testing Philosophy

- **Test behavior, not implementation**
- **Focus on user interactions**
- **Test error scenarios**
- **Keep tests simple and readable**

### Writing Tests

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe("ProjectCard", () => {
  it("displays project title and description", () => {
    // Arrange
    const project = { title: "Test Project", description: "Test desc" };

    // Act
    render(<ProjectCard project={project} />);

    // Assert
    expect(screen.getByText("Test Project")).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText("Test desc")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

Focus on testing:

- **Critical user flows** (authentication, project creation)
- **Complex logic** (status management, AI integration)
- **Error handling** (network failures, validation)
- **Accessibility** (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

## üìñ Documentation Guidelines

### Code Comments

- **Explain why, not what**
- **Document complex algorithms**
- **Add JSDoc for public APIs**
- **Keep comments up-to-date**

```typescript
/**
 * Generates smart tags for code snippets using AI analysis
 * @param codeSnippet - The code to analyze
 * @returns Promise resolving to suggested tags
 */
export async function generateSmartTags(
  codeSnippet: string
): Promise<string[]> {
  // Use Gemini AI to analyze code patterns and suggest relevant tags
  // This helps users organize their snippets more effectively
  return await aiTaggingFlow({ codeSnippet });
}
```

### README Updates

When adding features:

- **Update the features list**
- **Add usage examples**
- **Update screenshots** if UI changes
- **Mention breaking changes**

## üêõ Issue Guidelines

- **Clear description** of the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** the problem
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Screenshots** if applicable
- **Environment details** (browser, OS, Node version)

### Feature Requests

Use the feature request template and include:

- **Problem statement** - what problem does this solve?
- **Proposed solution** - how would you like it to work?
- **Alternatives considered** - what other approaches did you think of?
- **Additional context** - mockups, examples, etc.
